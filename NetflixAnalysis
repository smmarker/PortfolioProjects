In this SQL code, I practiced querying a database with Netflix data to answer questions about the data.

--practice a join
SELECT title, director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS people
ON titles.show_id = people.show_id;

--How many movie titles are there? 6131 movies
SELECT COUNT(title)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
WHERE type = 'Movie';

--Most recent database additions? Result is a list
SELECT title, date_added
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
WHERE date_added IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY date_added DESC;

--Result is the most recent date
SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles;

--List the movies in alphabetical order
SELECT title 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS title
ORDER BY title;

--Who was the director for the movie Bright Star?
SELECT director 
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" AS people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
ON people.show_id = titles.show_id
WHERE title = 'Bright Star';

--What is the oldest movie in the database? What year was it made?
--Pioneers, 1925
SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
ORDER BY release_year ASC
LIMIT 1;

--Which countries have titles in the database?
SELECT DISTINCT (country)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles
ORDER BY country ASC;

--How many countries are in the database?
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" AS titles;
